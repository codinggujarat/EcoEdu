# 🌱 EduEco
### AI-Powered Environmental Awareness Platform

EduEco is an AI-driven, gamified environmental education platform that motivates students to take real-world eco-friendly actions. By combining Agentic AI, computer vision, recommendation systems, and gamification, EduEco transforms sustainability learning into an engaging, measurable, and rewarding experience.

This project was built for a hackathon environment, focusing on innovation, automation, and real-world impact.

## 🌍 Problem Statement

Environmental awareness among students is often limited to theory, with little motivation or verification of real-world action. Existing platforms lack:
*   Action-based learning
*   Automated validation
*   Personalized engagement
*   Formal recognition for impact

EduEco solves this gap by encouraging students to perform real eco-activities, verifying them using AI, and rewarding genuine impact with certificates and achievements.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧠 Agentic AI Core
EduEco uses multiple AI agents working together to automate decisions and improve engagement:

*   **Automated Challenge Verification**
    *   Uses MobileNetV2 (TensorFlow) to analyze uploaded images
    *   Detects eco-activities like tree planting, waste segregation, recycling
    *   Reduces manual verification effort

*   **Smart Challenge Recommendations**
    *   TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity
    *   Suggests challenges based on past behavior and interests

*   **Fraud Detection Agent**
    *   Detects abnormal submission patterns
    *   Prevents point abuse and duplicate uploads

*   **Intelligent Eco-Tips**
    *   Context-aware daily tips for sustained engagement

*   **NLP Journal Analysis**
    *   Uses sentiment analysis (TextBlob)
    *   Encourages students with AI-generated feedback

### 🎮 Gamification & Rewards
*   **Eco-Points & XP System**
    *   Points awarded based on challenge difficulty
    *   Progressive leveling system
*   **Levels**
    1.  Eco Newbie 🌱
    2.  Green Explorer 🍀
    3.  Eco Warrior 🌍
    4.  Planet Protector 🌎
    5.  Earth Guardian 🌳
*   **Achievements & Badges**
    *   Automatically unlocked based on milestones

### 🏆 Automated Certificate System (NEW)
*   Certificates awarded every 1000 Eco-Points
*   Uses a professional PDF template
*   Automatically replaces "NAME" with the student’s username
*   One certificate per milestone (no duplicates)
*   Downloadable from the student dashboard
*   Acts as formal recognition for real-world environmental impact

### 📊 Interactive Dashboard
*   Eco-points growth charts
*   Achievement and challenge analytics
*   Learning journey visualization
*   GitHub-style contribution heatmap
*   Certificate download section
